# Space
 This is my solution to an asteroid data gathering code challenge.

## Usage:
 `python space.py [past|present|future|4_digit_year-month]`
 
 The argument is optional and can be either of the following:
 
 - past: will return the past 30 days for the month of closest approaches
  
 - present: will return the past 15 days and the upcoming 15 days for the month of closest approaches
  
 - future: will return the upcoming 30 days for the month of closest approaches
  
 - 4_digit_year-month (ex. 2015-03): will return the closest approaches for all days in that month
